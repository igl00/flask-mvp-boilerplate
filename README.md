Flask Boilerplate
====

A starting point for small, proof of concept flask projects using HTML5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap 4.

Created by modifying the output from [initializr](http://www.initializr.com/) for a flask project.  
The icons were generated using [real favicon generator](http://realfavicongenerator.net/).
